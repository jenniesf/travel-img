<h3 id="howItWorks">How It Works</h3>

<p>
I built a full-stack CRUD application for users to upload and share vacation photos. I was inspired by Instagram and I wanted to create a similar social media application experience. 

Upon loading the webpage, an unauthenticated user is directed to the home page and authenticated user is directed to their profile. The home page includes a snippet about the site and the user can either log in or register a new account.

Once authenticated or registered, the user is directed to their profile. Here, the user can upload images or go to the public feed. Feed is where users can view all vacation images shared on the site. 
</p>


<h3 id="whatILearned">What I Learned</h3> 
This was a fun project and I learned how to:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Use Bootstrap framework and read and research documentation</li>
  <li>Use Passport for user authentication</li>
  <li>Use Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data to upload files</li>
  <li>Use Cloudinary to host user images</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h3>
There are many additional features I plan to include, such as the following items: 
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Add additional profile features, such as a user profile pictures and about me section</li>
  <li>Add friends list and search for friends feature</li>
  <li>Additional features in the user dashboard and styling to improve the overall UX/UI</li>
</ul>
